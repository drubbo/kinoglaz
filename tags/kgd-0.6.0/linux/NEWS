                media kinds

10/02/2010      Media descriptors are now shared between RTSP connections
                through threaded iterators

                On PAUSE issue, RTP sessions are now awaited to effectively
                go to sleep

                RTCP sender / RTP threads were affected by a synchronization
                bug that caused the RTP thread to hang on infinitely, when
                TEARDOWN was issued very quickly before the first RTCP packet
                could be sent.
